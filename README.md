## Details
This is a website I created while doing the projects on freecodecamp.com. I had a great time working on this because I was really able to start utilizing the html and css that I had been studying at the time. Working on this project gave me a solid foundation in understanding how to position elements using CSS.

This was also my first React application and it gave me a lot of insight into understanding the benefits of React components. The app uses the html5 geolocation api for getting the user's latitude and longitude, the dark sky weather api for weather data, and the google maps api for reverse geolocating the latitude and longitude into a human decipherable location.

List of technoligies used:

	- React and Webpack
	- DarkSky API
	- Google Maps API
	- HTML5 Geolocation
